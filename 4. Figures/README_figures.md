Article figures as raw files, directly printed from R. I slightly modified them in vectorgraphics program before submission (e.g. subtitles, labels, subplot marigins).

1. Fig. 2.pdf = Isotope biplots
2. Fig. 3.pdf = MixSIAR continous variable plot figure, x-axis = PC1
3. Supplementary Fig 3-4.pdf = MixSIAR continous variable plot figure, x-axis = POM N:C ratio (3) and Forest % (4)
4. Supplementary Fig 5.pdf = Omega sensitivity analysis
5. Supplementary Fig 6 = Linear coefficient with PC1 in ILR space.png = Posterior distribution of Linear coefficient with PC1 in ILR space for each species.
6. Supplementary Fig 8-9 = bacterial (8) and benthic algae (9) scenarios. MixSIAR continous variable plot figure, x-axis=PC1
