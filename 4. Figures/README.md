Article figures as raw files, directly printed from R. I slightly modified them in vectorgraphics program before submission (e.g. subtitles, labels, subplot marigins).

Fig. 2 = Isotope biplots
Fig. 3 = MixSIAR continous variable plot figure, x-axis = PC1

Extended data Fig 3-4 = MixSIAR continous variable plot figure, x-axis = POM N:C ratio (3) and Forest % (4)
Extended data Fig 5 = Omega sensitivity analysis
